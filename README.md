# Docker AirSpy SpyServer

Docker container for [AirSpy SpyServer](https://airspy.com/download),  with updated drivers for support for [RTL-SDR Blog V4](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/V4/) USB dongle.

Currently only for arm64 (e.g. Raspberry Pi 4 and 5).

[Docker HUB](https://hub.docker.com/r/nikotine1/spyserver)

## Summary

The container provides you with the SpyServer application running on port 5555. It has been tested with an RTL-SDR Blog V4 device. There is a [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Nikotine1/docker-spyserver/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file should you want to see how to correctly use the USB device. In fact, with `priviliged: true`, you no longer have to mount the USB device.

### Example

See [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Nikotine1/docker-spyserver/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

### Configuration

All configuration for this Docker container is done via environmental variables with sane defaults. To change a setting, simply set the appropriate environment variable.
